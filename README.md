# Lab 1. Fractals
- Draw a fractal (pythogoras tree) using only draw line function from graphics
library.
# Lab 2. Bresenham's line algorithm + Midpoint circle algorithm
- Implement Bresenham's line algorithm
- Implement Midpoint circle algorithm
- Rewrite fractal program (from lab 1) to use implemented Bresenham's line algorithm

# Lab 3. Wireframe model
Create a program to draw wireframe model. Requirements:
- Model description is read from .txt file, which contains: vertex world coordinates
and edges in form of pair of vertex indices
- Viewpoint can be changed
- Algorithms for transforming world->view->screen coordinates should be implemented from scratch,
graphics library can be used only to draw on 2D canvas.
- Provide 2 models: ordinary cube and custom model.
# Lab 4. Finding hidden lines
- Modify previuos program to hide (aka not draw) hidden lines.
- NOTE: `cup.dat` is not ready yet (not all triangles are specified).


P.S. Algorithms for lab 3 and 4 are implemented in accordance with the book `Programming Principles in Computer Graphics, L. Ammeraal.`
